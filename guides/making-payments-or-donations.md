# Making Payments or Donations

If you have a KuPay payment or KuPay donation link and don't know where to start, you're at the right place. Follow along and you're up and running in no time. You can skip over the parts you already know.

Steps:

1. Install Metamask
2. Get your tokens on Metamask
3. Visit the KuPay payment or KuPay donation link and make your payment

## 1. Install Metamask

Metamask is a wallet application, available for Chrome/Brave browsers and iOS and Android phones. Download it now: [https://metamask.io/download/](https://metamask.io/download/)

During the Metamask setup, you will create a new wallet (or import your existing wallet).

This is important, because this wallet is where you will store your tokens. Keep the secret words and private keys safe, because anyone in the world can use your wallet if they have that information. So keep it secret.

## 2. Get your tokens on Metamask

On some block chains such as Ethereum, you can buy your favorite tokens directly on Metamask. On other chains, such as KCC you can't. If you have tokens on other chains or exchanges (such as Kraken, FTX, Crypto.com and many others), you can bridge or withdraw them to KCC or to BSC. Or you can open an account on [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com) (with direct access to KCC) or [Binance](https://www.binance.com) with direct access to BSC.

## 3. Visit the KuPay payment or KuPay donation link and make your payment

If this is your first time visiting our website, Metamask is probably going to ask your **permission** to share your wallet address with our website. You need to allow this, so that we can tell Metamask how much you want to pay on which chain and to whom. It does not give us access to your funds.

Enter the amount. Then choose the token that you want to pay with. Then click Donate.

In the top-right of your screen, you can select the block chain. Only some block chains are available. This depends on the settings of the charity or merchant.

The Metamask window pops up after a few seconds. Check if all seems well, then click Confirm.

Depending on the block chain, it takes a few seconds for the transaction to be finalized.

Congratulations!
