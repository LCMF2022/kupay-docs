### Setup your wallet

When you add MetaMask, it will walk you through the process of creating a new wallet or importing an existing wallet. Just follow the steps. Always be careful with the details and keep them safe.

### Keep your wallet details safe

Many people get scammed.

MetaMask is in the middle for a reason. It knows your secret wallet details, so that websites never need to know them.

**So never ever ever enter your seed phrase or password or secret key on any website.**

### Adding Networks

By default MetaMask comes with Ethereum block chain details, but you probably want to add a few more block chains. On EVM compatible block chains, your wallet details are the same, so you can use the same account details.

Adding a new blockchain in MetaMask is easy. Click on the MetaMask icon. Then click on the active Network at the top (in the screenshot where it says **KCC Mainnet**) but if you have a new install it would probably say **Ethereum Mainnet**.\
Then click on **Add Network** at the bottom.

Now you will need to have the details for the new network (block chain) handy. Refer to the table below for some commonly used blockchain.
